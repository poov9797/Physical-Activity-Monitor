# Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of the Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset, which includes data from 9 subjects engaged in 18 different activities. The dataset comprises inertial measurement unit readings and heart rate monitor data. The goal of this analysis is to extract valuable insights into the relationships between various attributes and activities.
